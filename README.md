# Optimal-Control-Theory
## Description

Optimal control theory is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with finding a control
for a dynamical system over a period of time such that an objective function is optimized.
It has numerous applications in both science and engineering. Optimal control deals with the
problem of finding a control law for a given system such that a certain optimality criterion is
achieved.

## Overview

The report is mainly based on the first four chapters of [Calculus of Variations and Optimal
Control Theory - A Concise Introduction](https://g.co/kgs/KXQyxc) by Daniel Liberzon. The Zermelo’s river crossing
problem solved in the last chapter is inspired by Patrick Suhm’s YouTube video [Time
Optimal River Crossing Tutorial Based On Pontryagins Maximum Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ibEzxWy2Yk).
